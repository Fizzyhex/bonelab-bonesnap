# ðŸ“· BoneSnap - A BONELAB Screenshotting Tool
[Thunderstore](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/Fizzyhex/BoneSnap) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Fizzyhex/bonelab-bonesnap)

Take full-resolution screenshots of your game window! Captures save to your clipboard and underneath the `UserData\Screenshots` folder (this is configurable!).

## Compatibility

BoneSnap simply just takes a snapshot of your game window. In other words, it'll work with your favourite camera mods.

## Quality Control

BoneSnap will output as a lossless image (PNG) by default, you can optionally reduce the quality to output as a JPG and save on file storage.
